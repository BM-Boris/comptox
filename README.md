# 3D Visualisation using Plotly

**plotly.py** includes the function for creating interactive 3D scatterplots with adjustable markers size and labels. Using the function, html files were created : plot_bio.html, plot_hydro.html. In particular, graphs show the distribution of chemicals (were chosen by certain gene expression assays) based on AC50, hydrophobicity\~bioavailability, human exposure and production volume. Both graphs could be accessed by the following links:

[*127 Chemicals with Hydrophobicity variable*](https://bm-boris.github.io/comptox/plot_hydro.html)

[*30 Chemicals with Bioavailability variable*](https://bm-boris.github.io/comptox/plot_bio.html)
